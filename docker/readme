DOCKER
    - is a platform for building, 
    running and shipping applications in a consistent matter
    - if the application works on specific machine it should function 
    the same way it function on the different machine
    - it can package the whole application including all its need, nodejs, mongodb and more
    - it can install all the necessary requirements on an isolated machine called docker

if Application works on specific machine but not on other machine, 
this is the possible reason

1) One or more files are missing
2) if other machine have different software version
3) server settings

All of this can be solve but docker

DOCKER ACHITECTURE
- Client tak to Server (Docker Engine) tru REST API set on the background

- Linux can run only linux container
- Windows can run both windows and linux container bcoz it 
    has custom build Linux kernel

HOW TO START
- go to docs.docker.com
- choose the OS where you want to install (current docker version for windows 3.5.2)
- make sure "Enable Hyper V" and "Install Windows Component" are selected before installing

Virtual Machine VS Container

CONTAINER
- isolated environment for running Application, 
    allow multiple app to be run in an isolation
- lightweight bcoz doesn't need the full OS
- all container shares the same OS /  
   Kernel : ( engine of the computer that manage the application/ hardware resources )
- can start quickly bcoz it doesn't need to load the OS
- less hardware resources bcoz it doesn't need to give them the slice of memory

VIRTUAL MACHINE
- abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)
- we can run many Virtual machine in a ral physical mahine
- we can run application in an isolation environment
Hypervisor
    - help to run mac and windows in one machine
    - software use to manage virtual machine
    - type of Hypervisor VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V (windows only)
Problem with VM
    - each virtual machine requires full copy of the OS
    - slow to start( bcoz each VM has to be loaded live starting a pc )
    - resource intensive (bcoz each VM take a lice of real physical storage)
